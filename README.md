# RevBugBench
RevBugBench is a fuzzing benchmark based on [FuzzBench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench). Target programs in RevBugBench are generated by [FixReverter](). RevBugBench is part of the artifact of paper [FIXREVERTER: A Realistic Bug Injection Methodology for Benchmarking Fuzz Testing](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/zhang-zenong). To cite FixReverter and/or RebBugBench, please use [this bibtex](/cite.bib).
## benchmarks
Target programs in this directory consist of 8 fuzzing targets from _FuzzBench_ and 2 commonly fuzzed _Binutils_ utilities, injected with bugs by _FixReverter_. The version of each program can be found in the _Dockerfile_ in each program's directory. The target programs are formatted as _FuzzBench_ benchmarks, and can be directly added to _FuzzBench_ by copying to _benchmarks_ directory of _FuzzBench_.
## triage
This folder contains scripts for triage. See [this](/triage/README.md) for instructions.
